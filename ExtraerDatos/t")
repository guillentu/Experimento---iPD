'colormap' is a function from the file /usr/share/octave/4.0.2/m/image/colormap.m

 -- Function File: CMAP = colormap ()
 -- Function File: CMAP = colormap (MAP)
 -- Function File: CMAP = colormap ("default")
 -- Function File: CMAP = colormap ("MAP_NAME")
 -- Function File: CMAP = colormap (HAX, ...)
 -- Command: colormap MAP_NAME
 -- Function File: CMAPS = colormap ("list")
 -- Function File: colormap ("register", "NAME")
 -- Function File: colormap ("unregister", "NAME")
     Query or set the current colormap.

     With no input arguments, 'colormap' returns the current color map.

     'colormap (MAP)' sets the current colormap to MAP.  The colormap
     should be an N row by 3 column matrix.  The columns contain red,
     green, and blue intensities respectively.  All entries must be
     between 0 and 1 inclusive.  The new colormap is returned.

     'colormap ("default")' restores the default colormap (the 'jet' map
     with 64 entries).  The default colormap is returned.

     The map may also be specified by a string, "MAP_NAME", where
     MAP_NAME is the name of a function that returns a colormap.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then the colormap for
     the parent figure of HAX is queried or set.

     For convenience, it is also possible to use this function with the
     command form, 'colormap MAP_NAME'.

     'colormap ("list")' returns a cell array with all of the available
     colormaps.  The options "register" and "unregister" add or remove
     the colormap NAME from this list.
