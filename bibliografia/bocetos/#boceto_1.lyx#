Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Since Darwin's theory of species evolution was put forward there was some
 trouble to explain cooperative traits on animales and humans.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For that the darwin's theory incorporate two novels kinds of extention.
 The genetical kinship theory that Hamilton grounded mathematicaly (hamilton,64)
 and the reciprocation theory (Trivers, 71).
 Both appended theory able explanation of social altruism behavior through
 natural selection.
 The kinship theory that after landed on 
\emph on

 and Maynar Smith use in first time (Smith,64), talk about, on knowledge
 of the genetic relationships of the organism involved, how altruistic behavior
 between closed related individuals can being selected though the natural
 selection.
 This theory does not include the altruist act among distantly related organism
 and so that trivers' theory wether does it.
 The term

reciprocal altruism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was use for Trivers for cover this type of behavior and give explanation
 about how the selection favors the altruistic behavios in long run when
 in population there are reciprocity.
 Some of most relevant and releable examples about this type of cooperation
 are the Wilkinson studies in reciprocal foods sharing behavior in vampires
 bats, rotundus, (wilkinson,1984) wheres they share a part of harverted
 food only a partnet that previously being shared.
 Other about it, ....
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diferent conditions must be fullfilled to warranted that reciprocally altruistic
 behavios will be selected for.
 Wilkinson make a clear brief of conditions must be satisfied to assure
 that the selection favor reciprocal altruismo behavior: 
\shape italic
(1) the behavior must reduce a donor’s fitness relative to the selfish alternati
ve, (2) the fitness of the recipient must be elevated relative to a nonrecipient
, (3) performance of the behavior must not depend on receipt of an immediate
 benefit, (4) a mechanism for detecting individuals who receive benefits
 but never pay altruistic costs has to exist, and (5) a large but indefinite
 number of opportunities to exchange aid must exist within each individual’s
 lifetime
\shape default
 (wilkinson, 1987).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investigation about cooperation along non-related organism gain a new
 impulse since Trivers present model of reciprocal altruism because it allowed
 to evaluate reciprocal animals behaviors with famous mathematical Prisioner's
 Dilemma (PD) game (quien desarrollo el dilema).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PD game is one class of 2x2 game that involve two players who must to
 choose between two options, generally called cooperation and defection.
 The pay-off is given depending of your choice.
 For example, if both chose cooperation or defection options both get respective
ly pay-off R (reward) or P (Punishment) and if one choose cooperation and
 second player choose defection the first get pay-off S (sucker) and other
 pay-off T (tentation) where pay-off matrix maintain inequality T>R>P>S.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both iPd and Evolutionary Stable Strategies (von Neumann and Morgenstern,
 1944, and Nash, 1949) predict to or give a sign what behavior (strategy)
 is likely to happen if it is adopt by the population, in such a way, no
 minority using a another strategy can invade (M.
 Smith, 1974).
 When the 2x2 prisioner's dilemma is playing for once the unique ESS es
 Defeat strategy.
 Nevertheless, when use pay-off matrix that meets 2R>T+P and player indefinite
 numbres of times the best strategy is mutual cooperation.
 It that means to each player always must to choose cooperation option.
 It does not means that if one does not cooperate the option remains be
 the best option, but is the worst option.
 Axelrod and Hamilton (1981) expose that some organisms simbiosis can be
 understand through reciprocal altruism but when organism can remember at
 least one previous intereaction and outcomes and is able to distingish
 differente individuals then the strategies situation becomes much richer
 set of posibilities.
 They put over a ESS for iterated PD as the result of computer tournament
 and was submitted by Anatol Rapoport that gather robustness and stability
 and initial viability, called TIT FOR TAT, with which an individual can
 survive invades to other strategies.
 The highly simple strategy roots inside simply one cooperate on the first
 move and then doing whatever the oponent did on the preceding move.

Thus, many experimenters have tried to understand different aspects of reciproca
l altruism behavior in animals and if non-human animals with less ability
 can solve iPD.
 Basically we want to comprise what abilities are essencial for.
 Green, Price and Hamburger (1995) assess iterated prisioner's dilemma game
 over pigons and observated that birds are so impulsivity and prefer small
 immediate outcomes rather than big long-term delayed outcomes.
 Stevens and Stephens (2003) use Blue jays on four different pay-off matrix,
 where one of them is the iPD matrix, over special dual operant box.
 This study found little cooperation in prisioner's dilemma treatment and
 this findings suggest that jays don't cooperate when immediate benefit
 is available (defect only), even if a long-term benefit may exist.
 Then in Steven et al.
 (2002 and 2005) inspired by low level of cooperation (Gardner et all.
 1984, Clements and Stephens 1995, Flood et al.
 1983, Green et al.
 1995) proposed payoff accumulation and temporal clumping to iPD game using
 blue jays in a kind of apparatus that consisted of side by side V-shaped
 compartiment.
 They found that combined both accumulation and clumpling treatment birds
 show a level of cooperation over chance choice.
 But in Danchin et.
 al.
 (2006) critized these treatment arguing that iPD payoff matrix becomes
 stag hung matrix after each accumulation blocks.
 Adams and Mesterton-Gibbons points out that in Stevens et al.
 (2002) found that birs care less about the immediacy of reward if seeds
 accumulation in a transparent food tray for some time befores being deliver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, Mendres and Waal(2000) and Waal(2000), used a pulling task over
 Capuchin monkeys (cebus apella) and a chamber divided for mesh to tests
 cooperation.
 They got that monkeys can adjust pulling task behavior according to their
 partner's presence and the food shared behavior depend of quality of own
 and partner foods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, Mendres and Waal(2000) and Waal(2000) tested cooperation aspects
 using a pulling task over Capuchin monkeys (cebus apella) and a chamber
 that was partitioned by means of a mesh with two food bowl on a tray.
 The monkeys can get foods pulling sticks attached at the side of the tray,
 one for each.
 They got that monkeys can adjust pulling task behavior according to their
 partner's presence and the food shared behavior depend of quality of own
 and partner foods.
 Similarly, using a pulling task to give food to a partner and receive from
 a altruistic partner Hause et al.(2003) evaluated altruistic food giving
 behavior where share food through mesh was not allowed over genetically
 unrelated cotton-top tamarin mokeys and showed that monkeys give more or
 less foods to partner taking into account what was altruistic and what
 not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing that pimates have high psicologic capability we can expect that
 these kind of monkeys can able to learn reciprocal altruism despite of
 do not in wild, but the insteresting question is whether animals that less
 capabilities can learn reciprocal altruismo.
 For the same way that monkeys experiments, Rutte and Taborsky (2007) assess
 generalized reciprocity in female rats (
\emph on
Rattus norvegicus
\emph default
) by means of a alternating pulling task in wich either the focal rats adopt
 a role of either helper to give food to a partner or a receiver food from
 a partner over a like-Wall&Menders chamber scaled for rats.
 Generalized reciprocity is kind of reciprocal altruism between unrelated
 individuals where individual make altruistic behavior by previous social
 experience irrespective of partner identity.
 Experiment was carried out with two phase.
 The first, pre-training phase in which a humand experimenter taught focals
 rats to perform alternating reciprocal task and second, on experiment phase
 that after recieve help or not for several days from differents partners
 to get food were paired with a new partnet in role of potencial helper.
 We could make a comment about this last experiment over the perspective
 of operant conditioning owing to they has assessed extintion rate of pulling
 behavior after focal rats has or not received food for several days rather
 than rise the frecuency of behavior by interaction between playes.
 Then, Rutte and Taborsky (2007) evaluates direct versus generalised reciprocity
 using the same experiment set up.
 Direct reciprocity is a kind of reciprocate interaction in which a subjet
 A cooperate with B on account of B previously cooperate with A.
 They observe that rats the pull rate is higher and its delay to pull is
 lower on direct reciprocity than generalised.
 This means that know opponent is a more powers stimulus than unknown.
 Taborsky et al.
 (2012) shown that rats reduced pulling rate with increasing resistance
 to pull and Dolivo and Taborsky (2015) evince that rats take account the
 quality of foods received from opponent to future cooperation(
\emph on
pulling
\emph default
).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
--In our search of altruistic behavior over nonhumand and non-primate animals
 we maybe demur that rats behavior in taborsky's experiment didn't meet
 all conditions for reciprocal altruistic behaviour rather that they assessed
 a type of reciprocity, because rats don't receive punishment for either
 punishment or temptation outcomes--- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reciprocal altruism is widely tested by iterating prisioner dilemma, iPD,
 and the individual's decision rules size up by transition vector t, r,
 p, s that reflect the probability of cooperation when the previous trials
 resulted in outcomes of R, T, S or P, respectively (stevens and stephens,2004).
 if all componente of vector are 0.5, the agent's decision rule is randomly
 irrespective last outcome.
 Part of experiment set developed by Wood et al.
 (2016) was measure reciprocal altruism in long-evans male and felmale rats
 using iPD in operant chamber divide half by removable mesh equiped with
 retractable lever and stimulus light.
 The best result show that male rats cooperative behavior is a little over
 the chance near to 60%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test whether the rat has ability to solve the iPD game when faced to
 altruist opponent we need to force TIT FOR TAT mimic behavior on the opponent
 (stevens & stephens 2002, St-Pierre, Larose & Dubois 2009, viana, Gordo,
 Sucena & Moita 2010).
 In Moita 
\emph on
et al.

\emph default
 using a mimic tit-for-tat stategy on the opponent in a doble T-maze chamber
 and neither reach a high level of cooperation.
 Our further analysis over their markov chain diagram gave evidence that
 strategy performed by rat was more selfish than cooperative because its
 adopts a alternating decision's rule among sucker and temptation outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are interesting to assess whether the rat can learn to solve iterates
 Prisioner when face to reciprocated altruistic opponent  altruistics behavior
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the result archieved by above experiment we propose a experiment
 set-up to test altruistic behaviors and also other behavios and matrix
 payoff searching
