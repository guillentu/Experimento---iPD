Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Since Darwin's theory of species evolution was put forward there was some
 trouble to explain cooperative traits on animals and humans.
 For that the Darwin's theory incorporate two novels kinds of extension.
 The genetically kinship theory that Hamilton grounded mathematically (Hamilton,
64) and the reciprocation theory (Trivers, 71).
 Both appended theory able explanation of social altruism behavior through
 natural selection.
 In evolutionary biology, reciprocal altruism is a behavior whereby organism
 perform costly act that benefit the recipient with expectation that the
 other organism act similar manners at later time o in next generation.

\begin_layout Standard
The kinship theory that after landed on

 and Maynar Smith use in first time (Smith,64), talk about, on knowledge
 of the genetic relationships of the organism involved, how altruistic behavior
 between closed related individuals can being selected though the natural
 selection.
 This theory does not include the altruist act among distantly related organism
 and so that Trivers' theory does it.
 The term

reciprocal altruism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was use for Trivers for cover this type of behavior and give explanation
 about how the selection favors the altruistic behaviors in long run when
 in population there are reciprocity.
 Some of most relevant and reliable examples about this type of cooperation
 are the Wilkinson studies in reciprocal foods sharing behavior in vampires
 bats, rotundus, (Wilkinson,1984) wheres they share a part of harvested
 food only a partner that previously being shared.
 Other about it, ....
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different conditions must be fulfilled to warranted that reciprocally altruistic
 behaviors will be selected for.
 Wilkinson make a clear brief of conditions must be satisfied to assure
 that the selection favor reciprocal altruism behavior: 
\shape italic
(1) the behavior must reduce a donor’s fitness relative to the selfish alternati
ve, (2) the fitness of the recipient must be elevated relative to a non-recipien
t, (3) performance of the behavior must not depend on receipt of an immediate
 benefit, (4) a mechanism for detecting individuals who receive benefits
 but never pay altruistic costs has to exist, and (5) a large but indefinite
 number of opportunities to exchange aid must exist within each individual’s
 lifetime
\shape default
 (Wilkinson, 1987).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research on cooperative behaviors along non-related organism gain a new
 impulse since Trivers connect reciprocal altruism behaviors with famous
 mathematical Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game (framed by Merrill Flood and
 Melvin Dresher 1950).
 The PD game is one class of 2x2 game that involve two players who must
 to choose between two options, generally called cooperation and defection.
 The size of reward to delivered is according both player's choice.
 For example, if both chose cooperation options both get pay-off R (reward),
 if both choice defection each other get pay-off P (Punishment) and if one
 choose cooperation and the second player choose defection the first get
 pay-off S (sucker) and other pay-off T (temptation) where pay-off matrix
 maintain inequality T>R>P>S.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both iPD and Evolutionary Stable Strategies (von Neumann and Morgenstern,
 1944, and Nash, 1949) predict, or give a sign, what behavior (strategy)
 is likely to happen whether it is adopt by the population, in such a way,
 no minority using a another strategy can invade (M.
 Smith, 1974).
 When the 2x2 prisoner's dilemma is playing for once the unique ESS es Defeat
 strategy.
 Nevertheless, when use pay-off matrix that meets 2R>T+P and play indefinite
 numbers of times the best strategy is mutual cooperation.
 It does not means that if one does not cooperate the option remains be
 the best option but it is the worst option.
 Axelrod and Hamilton (1981) expose that some organism's symbiosis can be
 understand through reciprocal altruism's model and when organisms can remember
 at least one previous interaction, outcomes and they are able to distinguish
 partner's difference then the strategies situation becomes much richer
 set of possibilities.
 They present a ESS for iterated PD that gather robustness and stability
 and initial viability, called TIT FOR TAT.
 It was arise as the winner strategy, submitted by Anatol Rapoport in the
 Robert Axelrod's computer tournament, because an individual that used it
 can survive invades to other strategies.
 The highly simple strategy roots inside that one cooperate on the first
 move and then doing whatever the oponent did on the preceding move.

Thus, many experimenters have tried to understand different aspects of reciproca
l altruism behavior in animals and whether non-human animals with less ability
 can solve iPD.
 Basically we want to comprise what abilities are essential for.
 Green, Price and Hamburger (1995) assess iterated prisoner's dilemma game
 over pigeons and observed that birds are so impulsive and prefer small
 immediate outcomes rather than big long-term delayed outcomes.
 Stevens and Stephens (2003) use Blue jays on four different pay-off matrix,
 where one of them is the iPD matrix, over special dual operant box.
 This study found little cooperation in prisoner's dilemma treatment and
 this findings suggest that jays don't cooperate when immediate benefit
 is available (defect only), even if a long-term benefit may exist.
 Then in Steven 
\emph on
et al
\emph default
.
 (2002 and 2005) inspired by low level of cooperation (Gardner et all.
 1984, Clements and Stephens 1995, Flood et al.
 1983, Green et al.
 1995) proposed payoff accumulation and temporal clumping to iPD game using
 blue jays in a kind of apparatus that consisted of side by side V-shaped
 compartment.
 They found that combined both accumulation and clumping treatment birds
 show a level of cooperation over chance choice.
 But in Danchin et.
 al.
 (2006) criticized these treatment arguing that iPD payoff matrix becomes
 stag hung matrix after each accumulation blocks.
 Adams and Mesterton-Gibbons points out that in Stevens et al.
 (2002) found that birds care less about the immediacy of reward if seeds
 accumulation in a transparent food tray for some time before being deliver.

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, Mendres and Waal(2000) and Waal(2000), used a pulling task over
 Capuchin monkeys (cebus apella) and a chamber divided for mesh to tests
 cooperation.
 They got that monkeys can adjust pulling task behavior according to their
 partner's presence and the food shared behavior depend of quality of own
 and partner foods.

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, Mendres and Waal(2000) and Waal(2000) tested cooperation aspects
 using a pulling task over Capuchin monkeys (cebus apella).
 They use a chamber that was partitioned by means of a mesh with two food
 bowl on a external tray.
 The monkeys can get foods pulling sticks attached at the side of the tray,
 one for each.
 They got that monkeys can adjust pulling task behavior according to their
 partner's presence and the food shared behavior depend of quality of own
 and partner foods.
 Similarly, using a pulling task to give food to a partner and receive from
 a altruistic partner Hause et al.(2003) evaluated altruistic food giving
 behavior where share food through mesh was not allowed over genetically
 unrelated cotton-top tamarin mokeys and showed that monkeys give more or
 less foods to partner taking into account what was altruistic and what
 not.

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing that primates have high psychological capability we can expect that
 these kind of animals can able to learn reciprocal altruism despite of
 they not perform this behavior in wild, but the interesting question is
 whether animals with less capabilities can learn reciprocal altruism.
 For the same way that monkeys experiments, Rutte and Taborsky (2007) assess
 generalized reciprocity in female rats (
\emph on
Rattus norvegicus
\emph default
) by means of a alternating pulling task in which either the focal rats
 adopt a role of either helper to give food to a partner or a receiver food
 from a partner over a like-Wall&Menders chamber scaled for rats.
 Generalized reciprocity is kind of reciprocal altruism between unrelated
 individuals where individual make altruistic behavior by previous social
 experience irrespective of partner identity.
 Experiment was carried out with two phase.
 The first, pre-training phase in which a humans experimenter taught focal
 rats to perform alternating reciprocal task and second on experiment phase
 that after receive help or not for several days from differents partners
 were paired with a new partner in role of potential helper.
 They observe the rats pull more frequently when previously received interaction
 with food-givers partner.
 We could make a comment about this last experiment over the perspective
 of operant conditioning owing to they has assessed extinction rate of pulling
 behavior after focal rats has or not received food for several days rather
 than rise the frequency of behavior by interaction between players.
 Then, Rutte and Taborsky (2008) evaluates direct versus generalized reciprocity
 using the same experiment set up.
 Direct reciprocity is a kind of reciprocate interaction in which a subject
 A cooperate with B on account of B previously cooperate with A.
 They observe that rats the pull rate is higher and its delay to pull is
 lower on direct reciprocity than generalized.
 This means that know opponent is a more powers stimulus than unknown.
 Taborsky

 (2012) shown that rats reduced pulling rate with increasing resistance
 to pull and Dolivo and Taborsky (2015) evince that rats take account the
 quality of foods received from opponent to future cooperation(

).

\begin_layout Standard
-creo que este párrafo no va----In our search of altruistic behavior over
 non-humans and non-primate animals we maybe demur that rats behavior in
 taborsky's experiment didn't meet all conditions for reciprocal altruistic
 behavior rather that they assessed a type of reciprocity, because rats
 don't receive punishment for either punishment or temptation outcomes-----
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reciprocal altruism is widely tested by iterating prisoner dilemma, iPD,
 and the individual's decision rules size up by transition vector t, r,
 p, s that reflect the probability of cooperation when the previous trials
 resulted in outcomes of R, T, S or P, respectively (stevens and stephens,2004).
 if all component of vector are 0.5, the agent's decision rule is randomly
 irrespective last outcome.
 Part of all experiment set developed by Wood et al.
 (2016) was measure reciprocal altruism in long-evans male and female rats
 using iPD in operant chamber divide half by removable mesh equipped with
 retractable lever and stimulus light.
 The best result show that cooperative behavior on male rats is a little
 over the chance near to 60%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test whether the rat has ability to solve the iPD game when faced to
 altruist opponent we need to force TIT FOR TAT mimic behavior on the opponent
 (stevens & stephens 2002, St-Pierre, Larose & Dubois 2009, viana, Gordo,
 Sucena & Moita 2010).
 In Moita 
\emph on
et al.

\emph default
 using a mimic tit-for-tat strategy on the opponent in a double T-maze chamber
 and neither reach a high level of cooperation.
 Our further analysis over their markov chain diagram gave evidence that
 strategy performed by rat was more selfish than cooperative because its
 adopts a alternating decision's rule among sucker and temptation outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rats often develop on social groups and studies have demostrated that
 they prefer social reward rather that along or have a tendency to performed
 pro-social acts over the chance (Moita 2015 and Kalenscher 2015).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But why all iPD-base studies haven't found high level of reciprocity? We
 considering about previous result in which the rat don't reach learn iPD
 and think that is maybe due to the test box and stimulus contingency are
 inadequate for its natural expectation, i.e.
 the rat maybe has ability to achieve a approximated optimal solution but
 for example the length of time used for made contingency is longer that
 rats can keep in mind or maybe don't realized the real difference within
 payoff matrix amounts.
 As a result, we found that combining iterated Prisoner's Dilemma matrix
 payoff and delay's penalty for released reciprocation and tit for tat opponent'
s strategy achieve high level of reciprocal altruism behavior in rats.

\begin_layout Standard
Two group of naive long-Evans rats (Charles Rivers....) were used.
 Twelves males were used like subjects and six (Nstooge=6) identical rats
 like opponents.
 At weaning time all subject were housed in pair per cage to addressing
 social interaction and each stooge in single individual cage.
 We had 12 cage altogether.
 The rat started the experiment when had 60 days old.
 All rats were food deprivation schedule, and to subject rats daily food
 intake was restricted to keep animals at between 90-95% of free feeding
 body weight and to stooge rats at between 80-85% of free feeding body weight.
 The housing room had an average temperature of 22°C and 12:12h light:dark
 cycle on at 20:00 hours.
 Each experiment day of rats started before to give daily food ration but
 at the end of day they received a complementary food ration.
 the rats had free access to water.

\begin_layout Standard
We used two opposite standard operant chamber by Med-Association (Product
 ENV-008) in such manner that each rats from your cage can make olfactory
 and eye contact through metal windows (FIGURA 1 CAJAS).
 Each standard chamber was equipped with two levers at the sides and two
 stimulus light over each lever and a feeder in the center.
 The boxes were faced by the wall that has levers and stimulus light.
 To allow the contact among rats below each levers were placed a aluminum
 rectangular windows.
 The window's height were such that the lever's height was 80% of maximum
 height of the forepaws while rearing (F.
 Cabrera 
\emph on
et al.
\emph default
, 2013).
 The subject's feeder was in same wall and the opponent's feeder in wall
 back.
 Each feeders were equipped with a light that turn on when foods is coming.
 We used Med PC IV software suit (Product SOF-735) and PCI Operating Package
 for up to Eight Chambers (Product MED-SYST-8) equipped with control of
 multiple devices SmartCtrl (Product DIG-716B) and pedestal mount pellet
 dispenser for rat, 45mg (Product ENV-203-45).
