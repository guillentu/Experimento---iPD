Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ever since Darwin's theory of evolution was proposed, cooperative traits
 in animals and humans were challenging to explain.
 In order to do so, Darwin's theory incorporates two novel kinds of extensions:
 the genetically kinship theory that Hamilton grounded mathematically (Hamilton,
1964) and the reciprocal altruism theory (Trivers, 1971).
 Both appended theories are capable to explain social altruism behavior
 through natural selection.
 In evolutionary biology, reciprocal altruism is a behavior whereby an organism
 performs a costly act that benefits another organism and if this behavior
 is reciprocal by others organism later time or even in the next generation,
 they increase a long-time reward or their fitness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kinship theory that after landed on kin Selection and Maynar Smith use
 in first time (Smith,64), talk about, on knowledge of the genetic relationships
 of the organism involved, how altruistic behavior between closely related
 individuals can be selected though natural selection.
 This theory does not considers the altruistic act among distantly related
 organisms whereas Triver's theroy does.
 The term “reciprocal altruism” was first used by Trivers to refer to this
 type of behavior and therefore explain how selection favors altruistic
 behaviors in the long run when there is reciprocity in the interaction.
 Some of the most relevant and reliable examples about this type of cooperation
 are the Wilkinson studies in reciprocal food sharing behavior in vampires
 bats (Desmodus rotundus), (Wilkinson, 1984).
 In these experiments, animals share a part of the harvested food only to
 a partner that previously shared with them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Different conditions must be fulfilled to ensure that reciprocally altruistic
 behaviors will be selected.
 Wilkinson makes a clear summary of these conditions : (1) the behavior
 must reduce a donor’s fitness relative to the selfish alternative, (2)
 the fitness of the recipient must be elevated relative to a non-recipient,
 (3) performance of the behavior must not depend on receipt of an immediate
 benefit, (4) a mechanism for detecting individuals who receive benefits
 but never pay altruistic costs has to exist, and (5) a large but indefinite
 number of opportunities to exchange aid must exist within each individual’s
 lifetime (Wilkinson, 1987).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research on cooperative behaviors between non-related organisms has gained
 a new impulse since Trivers connected reciprocal altruism behaviors with
 the famous mathematical Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) (originally developped
 by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher 1950).
 The PD game is one class of 2x2 game that involves two players who must
 choose between two options, generally called cooperation and defection.
 The size of the reward delivered is established according both player's
 choice.
 If both chose the cooperation option both get payed a certain amount R
 (reward), and if both chose defection they both get payed a smaller reward
 P (punishment) than R.
 However if one cooperates and the second player defects, the first one
 gets payed S (sucker) and other receives the best amount T (temptation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (iPD), the Evolutionary Stable Strategies
 (ESS)(von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944; Nash, 1949) predict what behavior
 (strategy) is likely to occur, for example if a ESS is adopt by the population,
 in such a way, no minority using a another strategy can invade (Smith,
 1974).
 When the 2x2 PD is played only for one time the best ESS is Defeat strategy.
 Nevertheless, when the pay-off matrix employed meets 
\begin_inset Formula $T>R>P>S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2R>T+P$
\end_inset

 and the game is played an indefinite numbers of times, the best strategy
 is mutual cooperation.
 But if one stop reciprocity behavior the best option change to defeat.
 Axelrod and Hamilton (1981) showed that some organism's symbiosis can be
 understood through the reciprocal altruism's model and if organisms can
 remember the outcome of at least one previous interaction and they are
 able to recognize different partners, then the strategies situation includes
 a much richer set of possibilities.
 They present a ESS for iPD that combines robustness and stability with
 initial viability, called TIT FOR TAT.
 This strategy arised as the winner strategy, submitted by Anatol Rapoport,
 in the Robert Axelrod's computer tournament (Axelrod, 1984), because it
 can survive invasions from other strategies.
 The highly simple strategy consists in cooperating on the first move and
 then doing whatever the opponent did on the preceding move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, many experimenters have tried to understand different aspects of reciproca
l altruism behavior in animals and whether non-human animals with less cognitive
 abilities can solve iPD (Mendres & Waal,2000; Waal, 2000; Hause & colleagues,
 2003; Taborsky, 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2015, Wood, 2016; Kalenscher, 2015).
 Green, Price and Hamburger (1995) assessed the iPD game on pigeons and
 observed that birds are very impulsive and prefer small immediate rewards
 rather than big, long-term, delayed rewards.
 Stephens (1995) trained blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) using four different
 pay-off matrices, where one of them was the iPD matrix, with a special
 dual operant box.
 This study found little cooperation in PD treatment and this findings suggest
 that blue jays don't cooperate when immediate benefit is available (defect
 only), even if a long-term larger benefit may exist.
 Then Stephen and colleages (2002 and 2005) inspired by the low levels of
 cooperation observed (Gardner et al., 1984; Clements and Stephens, 1995;
 Flood et al., 1983; Green et al., 1995) proposed assess over iPD frame to
 the effect of a pay-off accumulation and temporal clumping treatment to
 iPD game using blue jays in an apparatus that consisted of side by side
 V-shaped compartments.
 They found that combining both accumulation and clumping treatment birds
 showed a level of cooperation that scarcely surpassed chance choice.
 However, Danchin and colleages (2006) criticized the Steven's experiment
 arguing that each accumulation block the iPD payoff matrix becomes stag
 hung matrix (whereby the temptation outcome, T, leave to be the best reward,
 R>T≥P>S) because the bird quantify the effective amount after four trials.
 The Stephens' studies is timely because it forces behavioral ecologists,
 and other behavioral researcher, not only to rethink the potential importance
 of temporal discounting, but also to address a number of other issues (Mesterto
n-Gibbons, 2002).
 Indeed, we can explain from the point of view of Operant Conditioning,
 the improve on cooperation levels in Stephen's work by adding a new conditionin
g stimulus to the game, transparent food storage, and in this way the game
 become more easy to predict where is the maximum reward in the game.
 Other issue to keep in mind is the kind of reinforcement and punishment
 used in the experiments, such as a iPD study with rats (Viana et al., 2010)
 that used mimicking a tit-for-tat strategy on the opponent and positive
 reinforcement and punishment in a double T-maze chamber and they achieved
 an apparent moderately high level of cooperation.
 Then in ours further analyzed of their Markov chain diagram shown that
 the strategy performed by rats was more selfish than cooperative because
 it adopted an alternating decision's rule among sucker and temptation outcomes,
 basically they flees from punishment(undisclosed data).

 lo último que decimos)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why all iPD-based studies haven't found high levels of reciprocity? In the
 aforementioned previous studies, animals don't learn iPD probably due to
 the fact that the reinforcement and punishment and stimulus contingency
 are inadequate for its natural acquisition capability, i.e.
 the rat maybe has the ability to achieve an approximated optimal solution
 but for example the length of time used to make the contingency is longer
 than what rats can keep in mind or maybe they don't realized the real differenc
e within outcomes in the pay-off matrix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these consideration, the present study was conduct to assess reciprocal
 altruism behaviors using a particular structure that combine iPD matrix
 pay-off and timeout punishment with a tit for tat opponent's strategy.
 We assess a iterated PD in two phase: first normal iPD and then, in a second
 phase, a reversion iPD using the previous animals set.
 We found that this combination achieve high level of reciprocal altruism
 behavior in rats.

\begin_layout Standard
Two groups of male Long-Evans rats (300–330 g) of two months of age were
 provided by the IBYME-CONICET.
 Twelves males were subjects and six (Nstooge=6) identical rats were opponents.
 At weaning time all subjects were housed in groups of two rats per cage
 to allow social interaction, whereas each stooge was housed in single individua
l cages.
 We had 12 stainless-steel cages altogether with sawdust as bedding and
 metal lids.
 All rats were food restricted to maintain animals at between 90-95% or
 80-85% of free feeding body weight for subjects and stooges respectively.
 All animals were kept in a well-ventilated, temperature-controlled room
 (22 ± 2 °C) with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 8 am).
 Tap water was available ad libitum.
 To ensure that animals obtained sufficient food to survive, we provided
 supplementary food (at 22hs) for any rats that obtained the average amount
 of pellet to maintain body weight.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All behavioral procedures were performed during the light phase of the light/dar
k cycle, using a standard operant chambers (MED associates Inc., USA) with
 Med PC IV software suit (Product SOF-735) and PCI Operating Package for
 up to Eight Chambers (Product MED-SYST-8) equipped with control of multiple
 devices SmartCtrl (Product DIG-716B) and pedestal mount pellet dispenser
 for rat, 45mg (Product ENV-203-45) and standard operant chambers (Product
 ENV 008).
 White noise with a flat power spectral density was used to reduce sensibility
 to ambient noise.
 The training was perform on a single standard operant chamber equipped
 with tree retractable levers and tree stimulus light over each lever, and
 in the back wall placed a illuminated feeder.
 The experiment was conducted in special ad hoc dual chamber.
 We placed two Med association standard operant chambers facing each other
 in such manner that each rat could make olfactory and eye contact through
 metal windows (FIGURA 1 CAJAS).
 Each standard chamber was equipped with: two not retractable levers at
 the sides of the same wall and two stimulus light were placed over each
 levers, and in the center put a illuminated feeder.
 The boxes were faced by the wall that has levers and stimulus light.
 To allow the contact among rats we placed a aluminum rectangular windows
 below each levers.
 The window's height were such that the lever's height was 80% of maximum
 height of the forepaws while rearing (F.
 Cabrera et al., 2013).
 The subject's feeder placed in same wall and the opponent's feeder placed
 in back wall.
 Each feeders were equipped with a stimulus light that turn on when foods
 is coming.

 (Mazur, 1994, page 122) on a single chamber.
 The chamber was equipped as described above and was added a external lever.
 In this training, the external lever was manipulated by the operator to
 give reward as the rat go to the goal and finally when press lever.
 When the rat learned to press the lever after light onset, the operator
 left to gave reward with his lever.
 It training finished when the rat made the task for at least two session.
 Trials procedure: each trial began when the center stimulus light was turned
 on and the lever below it was ejected, then if either inner or outer levers
 wasn't pressed and 45 second had elapsed, the trials finished and not reward
 was given.
 But nevertheless, if either inner or outer levers was pressed, the light
 turn-off and the feeder's light was turned on, one second later a 45mg
 pellet is automatically dispensed, when 5 second elapsed all light were
 turn off and the lever was retracted, finally 5 second ITI started.
 The procedure was performed during 3 days or until the rats met task goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following, we exposed the rat to the same task but now the center lever
 during the session never more was retracted, the lever ejected at first
 trials and retracted at the last trials.
 In this training, when the rat pressed lever on ITI was punished with 2
 second delays added to 5 second of ITI.
 This procedure went on for tree days or until pressing rate was below one

 The purposed of the training was show them that two lever exist and balance
 rat lever's preference.
 The experiment was performed by 2 days in which on first day a rat use
 chamber 1 and on day 2 used chamber 2.
 This last allow not placed preference.
 The chamber communication windows were closed and any contact was suppressed.
 Each rat had two lever option and two light stimulus.
 When session started since the first to eighth trials only one pair stimulus
 light and lever worked and the next 8 trials(9-16) the another pair light-lever
 worked.
 What pair light lever started was randomly and in the second day was maintained
 in the same way.
 The trials procedure was identical to the previous one in the shaping.

Mimic tit for tat for opponent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opponent learned to develop a mimic tit for tat strategy by to learn
 a basic operant task.
 The opponent rat group was exposed to a fixed ratio (FR) schedule in dual
 operant chamber equipped in the same way.
 The pair light-lever was randomly assigned in each trials along the session.
 In this training, the rat must to press the lever that had light turned
 on.
 The other lever did not work during the trials and on the next trials the
 light-lever pair that worked was pseudo-randomly assigned.
 Pseudo-randomly means that the assigned was random but not allowed the
 same assigned for more than four time.
 The training was developed during five days and the FR schedule was increased
 step by step: day 1º the FR=2 and day 2º to 3º the FR=3, then day 4º the
 FR=4 and finally day 5º the FR=5.
 If the rat press the lever on ITI time received 2

Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main experiment was designed to study the reciprocal cooperation lever
 in a iterated prisioner's dilemma game.
 We used a pay-off matrix in which T>R>P>S.
 The T and R outcomes were positive reinforcement and P and S was punishment.
 The matrix coefficient are shown in table

.
 Thus, if both choose cooperation option (C) their pay-off was 1 for each
 other, If opponent choose C and the subject choose C or defection option
 (D), the subject received one pellet or 2 pellet, respectability.
 When the Opponent choose D and the subject choose C or D, the subject received

 delay of punishment and no pellet in this trial.
 The opponent strategy was conducted by turn on a light stimulus over the
 target lever, e.i.
 the opponent didn't choose freely and the side where light was turn on,
 the opponent had to develop a Fixed-ratio scheduler.
 The amount pellet preference was test previously and the rat shown more
 preferences for 2 pellet than 1 pellet.

\begin_layout Standard
Reciprocal altruism has been widely tested by iPD, where the individual's

 reflects the probability of cooperation when the previous trials resulted
 in outcomes of R(reward), T(temptation), S(sucker) or P(punishment), respective
ly (Stevens and Stephens,2004).
 If every component of this vector is 0.5, the agent's decision rule is random

 To assessing whether a subject was abled to solve the iPD game, we first

 random mode.
 We have to sort the type of strategy.
 The full data set that we record had difference length for each rat, because
 after recorded 20 sessions the experiment for each rat stop when the means

 The end of experiment for each rat was extended beyond 20 session in order
 to the rat was progressively finding some strategy.
 The rat that maintained a random strategy beyond 20 session was deserted.
 When the rat maintained a not random behavior at least for ten session,
 the experiment was stop.
 To test if rat strategy differs from chance strategy (v=[.5 .5 .5 .5]), we
 perform a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi{}^{2}$
\end_inset

 goodness of fit test on last ten session.

 The figure (

) shows the mean of cooperation for all rats and the asterisks marks denoted
 subject that had significant difference respect the chance.
 The subject 2A, 4A, 5A, 6A were removed from data pool because they not
 had a fixed strategy (See Supplementary materials for the graph of markov
 chain with probabilities of transition).
 Since the table

 we can see that there is a group of 8 rats with had a fixed no random strategy.

 we show the mean of reward per subject.
 The rats with not random strategies got many more reward than the removed

Theoretically, when a subject play iPD against TFT opponent, its the best
 strategy is All C and not TFT, because TFT against TFT when one defeat
 both remain in this state and never change.
 Thus, if the rats make a wrong choice, defeat, then its probability to
 cooperate must be high.
 Analyzing the not random strategy groups behaviors, we found that each
 rats had all components of strategic vector markedly above 0.5 suggesting
 that the rat's behaviors trend to be highly cooperative, see table

.
 The average strategy over all subject (blue color on table

\begin_layout Standard
The reciprocate strategy is mainly defined by the probability of mutual
 cooperation.
 Thus we made a graph of Mutual cooperations versus cooperation and saw
 that exist a directly proportional relationship between them, if mutual
 cooperate does down then the cooperate choice goes down, the correlation
 coefficient was 
\begin_inset Formula $0.996$
\end_inset

(
\emph on
Pearson coefficient
\emph default
).
 It result point out that both variable are related.
 See figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The color bar represent average accumulated punishment (second) that each
 subject obtain per sessions in the last ten session and also is drive by
 same relationship respect both mutual cooperation or cooperation choice,
 the correlation coefficient was 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.998$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.935$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 When cooperation up, the punishment down.
 In the figure, the square point represent theoretical simulated behaviors
 and used to compare the real average rat behavior respect to these repetitive
 simulated agent.
 We created the follow behaviors: 
\emph on

 and go back to the previous C lever and repeat the action.
 6º) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 These simulations allow to visualize specific behavior and make assumptions

 Since the simulated agent (filled square) are used to understand the kind
 of strategy used by the rats, we observe that the rats after make a defeat
 choice trend to learned that they have to back to cooperate choice.
 The rats of the group with lowest mutual cooperation level are near the

Second Phase: reversion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second phase experiment was developed to evaluate if the behaviors exhibit
 by the rats was either learned through the experience into the iPD game
 or was simply the choice of one lever, cooperation, by chance.
 If was by chance and now levers position change, the rats is going to choose
 same lever.
 We used four rats that got the best score in the previous experiment.
 In this phase, the levers order was inverted, i.e.
 if in previous experiment the lever meant cooperate, it became to defeat
 lever.
 We procedures in the same way as in the first experiment.
 The sessions duration per rat were: 
\size scriptsize
3A/52; 7A/52; 9A/52; 10A/24;
\size default
.
 The means of cooperation from the last 10 session is showed in the figure

 and the asterisk denote the rats with a some fix strategy that differs

Discussion and conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found a high lever of cooperation on all rats that develop some strategy,
 because the mean of the group was over 85%, fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig_evolutionCoop"

\end_inset

, and the transition vector depict the probability to cooperation given
 each outcome uphold the trend(the mean of each component is near or over
 80%).
 All animals learned that the best option wherever they are was cooperate
 or comeback to cooperate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The payoff matrix used in the experiment gives the same amount of reward
 to one that always cooperator as one that always alternate between cooperate
 and defect options.
 Nevertheless, there is a best strategy (
\emph on
pareto optimum
\emph default
) because the first strategy doesn't receive timeout punishment and the
 second does.
 Since the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig_reward VS timeout"

\end_inset

 we observe that the highest reward corresponds to the subject with the
 shortest accumulated timeout punishment and the highest cooperation choice
 level(light color).
 The simulated agent that used alternate strategy got the maximum punishment.
 Although, we see that all rats stay on a thin scatter between 85 to 100%
 of reward and the cooperation level spread out 65 to 100%, this means that
 at these levels of cooperation iPD game become very hard to understand
 whether the cooperation choice is still the best option or not and indeed
 the timeout maybe is how modulate what the rats will choose, because surely
 the rats with more sensitive to timeout avoid it and cooperate more.
 We found 5 of 8 rats were under 30% of punishment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contrast between rewards and also between punishments is very important
 for the animals can recognize the difference among behaviors.
 We use a pay-off T as double of pay-off R and the punishment S as double
 of P.
 if a animal chose temptation and persist pushing Defect option, then it
 will receive a big reward follow by timeout, but it
