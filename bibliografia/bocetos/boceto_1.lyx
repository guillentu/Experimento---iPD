Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Since Darwin's theory of species evolution was put forward there was some
 trouble to explain cooperative traits on animales and humans.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For that the darwin's theory incorporate two novels kinds of extention.
 The genetical kinship theory that Hamilton grounded mathematicaly (hamilton,64)
 and the reciprocation theory (Trivers, 71).
 Both appended theory able explanation of social altruism behavior through
 natural selection.
 The kinship theory that after landed on

 and Maynar Smith use in first time (Smith,64), talk about, on knowledge
 of the genetic relationships of the organism involved, how altruistic behavior
 between closed related individuals can being selected though the natural
 selection.
 This theory does not include the altruist act among distantly related organism
 and so that trivers' theory wether does it.
 The term

reciprocal altruism

 was use for Trivers for cover this type of behavior and give explanation
 about how the selection favors the altruistic behavios in long run when
 in population there are reciprocity.
 Some of most relevant and releable examples about this type of cooperation
 are the Wilkinson studies in reciprocal foods sharing behavior in vampires
 bats, rotundus, (wilkinson,1984) wheres they share a part of harverted
 food only a partnet that previously being shared.
 Other about it, ....
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diferent conditions must be fullfilled to warranted that reciprocally altruistic
 behavios will be selected for.
 Wilkinson make a clear brief of conditions must be satisfied to assure
 that the selection favor reciprocal altruismo behavior: 
\shape italic
(1) the behavior must reduce a donor’s fitness relative to the selfish alternati
ve, (2) the fitness of the recipient must be elevated relative to a nonrecipient
, (3) performance of the behavior must not depend on receipt of an immediate
 benefit, (4) a mechanism for detecting individuals who receive benefits
 but never pay altruistic costs has to exist, and (5) a large but indefinite
 number of opportunities to exchange aid must exist within each individual’s
 lifetime
\shape default
 (wilkinson, 1987).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investigation about cooperation along non-related organism gain a new
 impulse since Trivers present model of reciprocal altruism because it allowed
 to evaluate reciprocal animals behaviors with famous mathematical Prisioner's
 Dilemma (PD) game (quien desarrollo el dilema).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PD game is one class of 2x2 game that involve two players who must to
 choose between two options, generally called cooperation and defection.
 The pay-off is given depending of your choice.
 For example, if both chose cooperation or defection options both get respective
ly pay-off R (reward) or P (Punishment) and if one choose cooperation and
 second player choose defection the first get pay-off S (sucker) and other
 pay-off T (tentation) where pay-off matrix maintain inequality T>R>P>S.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both iPd and Evolutionary Stable Strategies (von Neumann and Morgenstern,
 1944, and Nash, 1949) predict to or give a sign what behavior (strategy)
 is likely to happen if it is adopt by the population, in such a way, no
 minority using a another strategy can invade (M.
 Smith, 1974).
 When the 2x2 prisioner's dilemma is playing for once the unique ESS es
 Defeat strategy.
 Nevertheless, when use pay-off matrix that meets 2R>T+P and player indefinite
 numbres of times the best strategy is mutual cooperation.
 It that means to each player always must to choose cooperation option.
 It does not means that if one does not cooperate the option remains be
 the best option, but is the worst option.
 Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981, expose that some organisms simbiosis can be
 understand through reciprocal altruism but when organism can remember at
 least one previous intereaction and outcomes and is able to distingish
 differente individuals then the strategies situation becomes much richer
 set of posibilities.
 They put over a ESS for iterated PD as the result of computer tournament
 and was submitted by Anatol Rapoport that gather robustness and stability
 and initial viability, called TIT FOR TAT, with which an individual can
 survive invades to other strategies.
 The highly simple strategy roots inside simply one cooperate on the first
 move and then doing whatever the oponent did on the preceding move.

Thus, many experimenters have tried to understand different aspects of reciproca
l altruism behavior in animals and if animals with less ability than humans
 can solve iPD.
 The fact is comprise what abilities are essencial.
 Green, Price and Hamburger (1995) assess iterated prisioner's dilemma game
 over pigons and observated that birds are so impulsivity and prefer small
 immediate outcomes rather than big long-term delayed outcomes.
